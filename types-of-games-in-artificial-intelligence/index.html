7 TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROPELLING THE From erpinnews.com
It’s difficult to people to point at a game and say “those characters were intelligent!”. Saves on costs and time. They don’t have a concept of the past, historical data, nor the ability. The earliest real artificial intelligence in gaming was the computer opponent in “pong” or variations thereof (of which there were many).
