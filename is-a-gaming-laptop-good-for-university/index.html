Best laptops to buy from NewEgg.ca for gaming From reddit.com
Without question, gaming laptops tends to have much higher pricing than desktops with identical specs. If that&#39;s the route you want to go, you can pick up solid 14 laptops for around £500 and put the rest towards the gaming pc fund. Gaming laptops are excellent for machine learning. I am wondering if i should build a pc for $1000 including peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor) or buy a gaming laptop?
