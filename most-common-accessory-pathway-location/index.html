Free wall locations are the most common positions for accessory pathways (aps) in clinical practice. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (avrt) is the second most common cause of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (svt) 1, 2 but the etiology of. The most common type (figure 3a) results from an electric circuit that travels from the atria through the av node to the ventricles, then backward through an accessory pathway. Posteroseptal accessory pathways (aps) are actually not septal but reside in a complex region bordering the right atrium, right ventricle, left ventricle, left atrium and.
